# NoSQL Social Network App

  ## Description

   For this challenge we were tasked with building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, using a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps was also optional.

  ## Usage

  1. Open the server.js in the terminal and run 'node server.js'.
  2. Send an HTTP request in Insomnia to Get all user info
  3. Once you have all user info, you can create or delete users, get and create Thoughts, add and remove friends, as well as create and remove reactions by adding different types of HTTP requests

  ## Technologies

  1. JavaScript
  2. Node.js
  3. Insomnia
  4. MongDB
